# Summary

The "Asia Minor Greek in Contact" treebank (AMGiC, UD_AMGiC) is compiled from sentences entailing contact-induced morphosyntactic phenomena (CIMSP) that are a result of the contact between Greek and Turkish varieties in Anatolia and in adjacent regions. The sentences are traced in Asia Minor Greek (AMG) dialectal sources. In addition to the UD analysis, the AMGiC treebank provides information concerning the sociolinguistic context within which CIMSP arise.

# Introduction

AMGiC is a UD treebank dealing with cases of Contact-Induced Morphosyntactic Phenomena (CIMSP) in Inner Asia Minor Greek (AMG) that emerged under the influence of Turkish. Inner AMG comprises several interrelated but clearly distinct Cappadocian subdialects as well as the varieties of Silliot and Pharasiot (cf. Manolessou 2019; Cappadocian Greek (CG), Silliot and Pharasiot are in fact classified as distinct dialects, cf. Janse 2020: 203). Given however that the ISO 639-3 code we utilize for AMGiC is *cpg*, i.e. "Cappadocian Greek", we employ CG as a *pars pro toto* designation for all Inner AMG varieties.

Apart from the annotation, AMGiC offers a detailed metadata section, in which CIMSP are tagged (cf. Sampanis & Prokopidis 2021). The current version (as of v2.15) of AMGiC is the first batch of the treebank including CIMSP traced in Silliot. Future versions of AMGiC will include CG and Pharasiot as well.
